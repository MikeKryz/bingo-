# Bingo Game - Development Instructions

## Development Checklist
- [ ] `npm run lint` - pass linting
- [ ] `npm run build` - verify production build  
- [ ] `npm run test` - pass all tests

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dev server: `http://localhost:5173/`

## Project Overview

**Soc Ops**: Social Bingo game for in-person events. React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Vitest.

### File Structure

```
src/
 App.tsx                 # Main component
 components/             # UI components (Board, Square, Modal, Screens)
 hooks/useBingoGame.ts   # Game state & logic
 utils/bingoLogic.ts     # Core game functions (pure logic)
 data/questions.ts       # Quiz questions
 types/index.ts          # TypeScript types
```

## Key Concepts

- **Game States**: `'start'` | `'playing'` | `'bingo'`
- **Board**: 25 squares (5x5) with center as free space
- **Bingo**: Detect 5 marked squares in row/column/diagonal
- **Persistence**: Game state saved to localStorage

## Common Tasks

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Add questions | `src/data/questions.ts` |
| Game logic | `src/utils/bingoLogic.ts` |
| Styling | Component files (use Tailwind v4) |
| New tests | `src/utils/bingoLogic.test.ts` |

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Vite dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run lint` - ESLint check
- `npm run test` - Vitest (21 tests)

## Guidelines

- Test utility functions thoroughly
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use Tailwind utilities for styling
- Strict TypeScript checking
- Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`

## Architecture

- **App**: Routes between screens based on gameState
- **useBingoGame**: Manages state, localStorage, bingo detection
- **bingoLogic**: Pure functions for game mechanics
- **Components**: Presentational UI only

See `.github/instructions/` for Tailwind v4 and design guidelines.
